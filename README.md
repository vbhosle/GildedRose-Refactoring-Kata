# Gilded Rose Refactoring Kata
Java base code taken from https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata. This repo has base code for other languages but no tests.

### [Gilded Rose Requirements](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata/tree/master/GildedRoseRequirements.txt)

## How to use this Kata
Clone the code and start at the first commit ```git checkout d6badd35141897654e57b1b2bf2790151448aa09``` [Add tests](https://github.com/vbhosle/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata/commits/d6badd35141897654e57b1b2bf2790151448aa09), hacking away improving the design. 
Tests for Conjured requirement are disabled initially. When you are ready remove @Disabled annotation in test.

This refactoring was done along with [Sandi Metz video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bZh5LMaSmE). Only difference being, we use Java here and we choose not to touch Items class (one of the requirement constraint).
This refactoring is left to good enough state, magic string could have certainly be converted to constants or enum. There could be more such small refactorings remaining.
